# PseudoArcLengthContinuation.jl

This package aims at solving equations $F(u,\lambda)=0$ where $\lambda \in\mathbb R$ starting from an initial guess $(u_0,\lambda_0)$. It relies on the pseudo arclength continuation algorithm which provides a *predictor* $(u_1,\lambda_1)$ from $(u_0,\lambda_0)$. A Newton method is then used to correct this predictor.

The current package focuses on **large** scale problem and multiple hardware. Hence, the goal is to use Matrix Free / Sparse methods on **GPU** or a **cluster** in order to solve non linear equations (for example PDE, nonlocal problems, sub-manifolds...).

One design choice is that we do not require `u` to be a subtype of an `AbstractArray` as this would forbid the use of spectral methods like the one from `ApproxFun.jl`. So far, our implementation does not allow this for Hopf continuation and computation of periodic orbits. It will be improved later.

Finally, we leave it to the user to take advantage of automatic differentiation as this field is moving too fast for now, albeit there are several well established packages like `ForwardDiff.jl` and `Zygote.jl` to name just a few.

## Installation 

This package requires Julia >= v1.3.0 because of the use of methods added to abtract types (see [#31916](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/31916)).

To install it, please run

`] add https://github.com/rveltz/PseudoArcLengthContinuation.jl`

## Other softwares

There are many good softwares already available, most of them are listed on [DSWeb](https://dsweb.siam.org/Software). One can mention the venerable AUTO, or also, [XPPAUT](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html), [MATCONT](http://www.matcont.ugent.be/) and [COCO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cocotools/). For large scale problems, there is [Trilinos](https://trilinos.org/), the versatile [pde2path](http://www.staff.uni-oldenburg.de/hannes.uecker/pde2path/), [CL_MATCONTL](https://github.com/careljonkhout/cl_matcontL) and the python libraries [pyNCT](https://pypi.org/project/PyNCT/) and [pacopy](https://github.com/nschloe/pacopy). Finally, there is also a MATLAB continuation [code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/inqwpl0mp7o1oy0/AvitabileICMNS2016Workshop.zip?dl=0) by [D. Avitabile](https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/plp/pmzda/index.html).


In Julia, we have for now a [wrapper](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/PyDSTool.jl) to PyDSTools, and also [Bifurcations.jl](https://github.com/tkf/Bifurcations.jl).

## A word on performance

The examples which follow have not **all** been written with the goal of performance but rather simplicity (except maybe [Complex Ginzburg-Landau 2d](@ref)). One could surely turn them into more efficient codes. The intricacies of PDEs make the writing of efficient code highly problem dependent and one should take advantage of every particularity of the problem under study.

For example, in the first tutorial on [Temperature model](@ref), one could use `BandedMatrices.jl` for the jacobian and an inplace modification when the jacobian is called ; using a composite type would be favored. Porting them to GPU would be another option.

## Main features

- Matrix Free Newton solver with generic linear / eigen *preconditioned* solver. Idem for the arc-length continuation.
- Matrix Free Newton solver with deflation and preconditioner. It can be used for branch switching for example.
- Bifurcation points are located using a bisection algorithm
- Branch, Fold, Hopf bifurcation point detection of stationary solutions.
- Automatic branch switching at simple branch points
- Fold / Hopf continuation based on Minimally Augmented formulation, with Matrix Free / Sparse Jacobian.
- Periodic orbit computation and continuation using Shooting or Finite Differences.
- Branch, Fold, Neimark-Sacker, Period Doubling bifurcation point detection of periodic orbits.
- Computation and Continuation of Fold of periodic orbits

Custom state means, we can use something else than `AbstractArray`, for example your own `struct` (see [Requested methods for Custom State](@ref)). 

**Note that you can combine most of the solvers, like use Deflation for Periodic orbit computation or Fold of periodic orbits family.**

## Requested methods for Custom State
Needless to say, if you use regulars arrays, you don't need to worry about what follows.

We make the same requirements than `KrylovKit.jl`. Hence, we refer to its [docs](https://jutho.github.io/KrylovKit.jl/stable/#Package-features-and-alternatives-1) for more information. We additionally require the following methods to be available:

- `Base.length(x)`: it is used in the constraint equation of the pseudo arclength continuation method (see [`continuation`](@ref) for more details). If `length` is not available for your "vector", define it `length(x) = 1` and adjust tuning the parameter `theta` in `ContinuationPar`.
